# JVN_Database
An intuitive dashboard empowering teams with efficient project management tools for Justice Video Network (JVN) of Ontario Service (Canada).

## Overview
Due to the reliance on Excel for managing various project progress and related data, information was often scattered across different files. Worse still, employees frequently had to update a project‚Äôs status across multiple sheets, leading to inconsistencies in data. As a software engineer, I found this situation frustrating, so I decided to design this project. It offers an intuitive and straightforward system for employees to manage data efficiently, helping to streamline collaboration across different teams.

## üß∞ Tech Stack
### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Port**: `3000`
- **Auth**: Microsoft OAuth 2.0 via Azure Active Directory
- **Token Handling**: Receives Microsoft access_token and exchanges it with backend for an API JWT token

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Port**: `4000` (exposed as `/api`)
- **Auth Flow**:
  1. Validates Microsoft access_token
  2. Issues JWT token for protected API access
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Storage**: Azure Blob Storage (used for file uploads)

### Infrastructure
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx
  - Routes `/api/*` to backend
  - Routes all other traffic to frontend
- **Process Manager**: PM2
  - Manages both frontend and backend processes within the VM
- **Deployment Target**: Single Linux-based VM

## üîê Authentication Flow

1. User logs in via Microsoft Azure AD
2. Frontend receives `access_token` from Azure
3. Frontend sends token to backend API
4. Backend verifies token and responds with custom **JWT**
5. JWT is used for all subsequent authenticated API calls

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Services Used

- **Azure Active Directory**: Handles OAuth2.0 authentication
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Stores file assets
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores relational data such as user info, file metadata, etc.

## üñ•Ô∏è Deployment Overview

All components are deployed and run inside a single Virtual Machine:

```bash
# Start frontend and backend using PM2
pm2 start frontend-app --name frontend
pm2 start backend-app --name backend
