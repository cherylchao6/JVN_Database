# JVN_Database
An intuitive dashboard empowering teams with efficient project management tools.

## Overview
Due to the reliance on Excel for managing various project progress and related data, information was often scattered across different files. Worse still, employees frequently had to update a projectâ€™s status across multiple sheets, leading to inconsistencies in data. As a software engineer, I found this situation frustrating, so I decided to design this project. It offers an intuitive and straightforward system for employees to manage data efficiently, helping to streamline collaboration across different teams.
